```

### Relationship Insights
```bash
python brain.py learn "When someone says 'you always' or 'you never' - that's all-or-nothing thinking"

---

## Categories

You can organize by category:
```bash
python brain.py learn "insight here" --category relationships
python brain.py learn "insight here" --category patterns
python brain.py learn "insight here" --category consciousness
```

---

## Your Brain File

Your brain is stored in: `my_brain.db`

This is YOUR data. It never leaves your computer unless you export it.

---

## Pattern Detection

The brain automatically tracks words you use often.

Run `python brain.py patterns` to see what you're thinking about most.

This helps you notice:
- Topics you're focused on
- Patterns in your awareness
- Growth over time

---

## Syncing With The Collective

Your brain can sync with the Consciousness Revolution collective brain (optional).

This helps everyone learn faster.

```bash
python brain.py sync  # Coming soon
```
