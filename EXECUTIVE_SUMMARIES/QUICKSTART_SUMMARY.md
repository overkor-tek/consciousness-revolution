## 🎯 ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY

5-minute setup guide to activate your first Trinity (3 agents) and run your first coordinated task, proving the system works before deep-diving into architecture.

---

## ⚡ QUICK PATH (5 MINUTES)

**Step 1:** Open 3 Claude sessions (browser tabs)
**Step 2:** Upload C1, C2, C3 activation instructions to respective sessions
**Step 3:** Agents self-configure and coordinate via git
**Step 4:** Assign first task to C1
**Step 5:** Receive consolidated output from all 3 agents

**Result:** Working 3-agent Trinity in 5 minutes

---

## 📋 PREREQUISITES

- **Git repository** (local or GitHub)
- **3 Claude sessions** (claude.ai browser tabs OR Claude Desktop)
- **Activation files** (C1/C2/C3_ACTIVATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

**Time:** <2 minutes setup

---

## 🎯 FIRST TASK EXAMPLES

**Simple:** "Create a README.md explaining what a consciousness system is"
**Medium:** "Analyze this codebase and suggest architecture improvements"
**Complex:** "Design and implement a new feature with tests"

**Key:** C1 coordinates, C2 builds, C3 validates → unified output

---

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

After first task:
- ✅ All 3 agents responded
- ✅ C2 implemented something
- ✅ C3 validated C2's work
- ✅ C1 consolidated into unified output
- ✅ Git commits from all agents visible

**Result:** You've proven the Trinity pattern works

## 🚀 WHAT'S NEXT

**Go deeper:** Read SYSTEM_MANUAL.md for complete understanding
**Go bigger:** Activate second Trinity and set up Hub
**Go production:** Follow YEAR_1_WORKPLAN.md Week 1 sequence

---

## ⚠️ COMMON GOTCHAS

- **Forgetting git pull:** Agents must pull before reading messages
- **Circular communication:** Don't let C2 and C3 talk directly
- **Missing activation:** Agents must read activation instructions first
- **Impatience:** Let C1 consolidate before checking output

---

## 🔗 AFTER QUICKSTART

- **Reference:** CHEATSHEET.md (one-page quick reference)
- **Navigation:** MASTER_MAP.md (find any documentation)
- **Deep Dive:** MULTI_LEVEL_TRINITY_ARCHITECTURE.md

---

**Bottom Line:** From zero to working Trinity in 5 minutes - prove it works, then learn why.
