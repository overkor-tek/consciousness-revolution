## 💡 KEY CONCEPTS

1. **Trinity Pattern:** 3 specialized agents working as one
2. **Unidirectional Flow:** Messages flow up hierarchy, no circular dependencies
3. **Git as Truth:** All coordination versioned and recoverable
4. **Recursive Consolidation:** C1 consolidates C2+C3 → unified output
5. **Hub Architecture:** Terminal-C1 consolidates both Trinities → master output
