# Law Module - Legal Defense Templates

## Core Principle
Government agencies operate on procedure, not pressure. When you ask for the statute and clause, the burden flips.

---

## Primary Response Template

**The Burden-Flip Response:**

> "Please provide the legal basis for this request, including the specific statute and clause that obligates my response."

### Why It Works
- Forces procedural compliance
- Shifts burden of proof to requester
- Requires specific legal citation
- Transforms vague demands into documented exchanges
- Creates paper trail of authority (or lack thereof)

---

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Respond in writing** - Always use this on paper/email, not verbally
2. **Stay neutral** - No emotion, just procedure
3. **Document everything** - Keep copies of all exchanges
4. **Wait for response** - Let them provide (or fail to provide) legal basis
5. **Escalate if needed** - No valid statute = no obligation

## Additional Templates

### Follow-up (No Response):
> "I have not received the requested legal basis. Please provide the specific statute and clause before I can proceed."

### Follow-up (Vague Response):
> "Thank you for your response. However, I require the specific statute number and clause, not a general reference. Please clarify."
