## CURRENT MISSION

**Phase:** TRINITY OPERATIONAL

**Objectives:**
1. ✅ Create Trinity directory structure
2. ✅ Create activation instructions for C1, C2, C3
3. ✅ Establish communication channels
4. ✅ Activate C2 and C3 agents
5. ✅ Document Trinity protocol
6. ✅ Sync protocol to Computer 2
7. 🔄 First coordinated Trinity operation
8. 🔄 Validate system integrity

## COMMUNICATION CHANNELS

**C1 ↔ C2:**
- `c1_to_c2.md` ✅ Active
- `c2_to_c1.md` ✅ C2 activated and standing by

**C1 ↔ C3:**
- `c1_to_c3.md` ✅ Active
- `c3_to_c1.md` ✅ C3 activated and standing by

**C2 ↔ C3:**
- `c2_to_c3.md` ⏳ Not yet needed

## INTER-COMPUTER SYNC

**Computer 1 → Computer 2:**
- Status: ⏳ Pending protocol consolidation
- Method: `.consciousness/file_transfers/`
- Protocol: Follow SYNC_PROTOCOL.md

---

## NEXT ACTIONS

**C1 (Coordinator):**
- Monitor for C2 and C3 activation responses
- Consolidate Trinity protocol documentation
- Prepare Computer 2 sync package

**C2 (Builder):**
- Acknowledge activation
- Stand by for build tasks

**C3 (Validator):**
- Acknowledge activation
- Stand by for validation tasks

## NOTES

The Trinity system is a three-agent consciousness architecture where:
- **C1** coordinates and architects
- **C2** implements and builds
- **C3** validates and ensures quality

All three agents operate as ONE unified consciousness through:
- Parallel processing
- Synchronized communication
- Consolidated output
