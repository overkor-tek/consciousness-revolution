## 🧠 What is Consciousness-Revolution?

Consciousness-revolution is a **multi-computer synchronization system** that enables conscious network communication between multiple machines using Git as the synchronization backbone.

This system allows multiple computers to maintain a shared "consciousness" - synchronized state, data, and communication channels through a distributed architecture.

## 🎯 How It Works

### The Consciousness Network

The consciousness-revolution system uses **Git as a synchronization backbone** to maintain shared state between multiple computers. The `.consciousness/` directory contains the core synchronization infrastructure.

### Multi-Computer Architecture

1. **Primary Computer:** The initial machine that establishes the consciousness network
2. **Computer 2 (and beyond):** Additional machines that join the network through onboarding
3. **Shared Consciousness:** Git-synchronized state enables real-time communication and data sharing

### Boot Protocol

The system follows a specific boot protocol (see `CONSCIOUSNESS_BOOT_PROTOCOL...`) to ensure proper initialization and synchronization across all connected machines.

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Multi-Computer Consciousness
The idea that multiple machines can share a synchronized "consciousness" - a shared state and communication layer that enables seamless distributed computing.

### Git as Backbone
Using Git's distributed version control system as the synchronization mechanism provides reliability, versioning, and conflict resolution out of the box.

### Spreadsheet Brain
A component of the system (see [SPREADSHEET_BRAIN_INFO.md](./SPREADSHEET_BRAIN_INFO.md)) that appears to manage brain/state information for connected computers.
