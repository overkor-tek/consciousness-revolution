Scarcity Manufacturing**\n• Pattern: Humans value things that appear rare\n• Manipulation: Artificial scarcity to create urgency\n• Example: 'Only 3 left!' when there are hundreds in the warehouse\n• Defense: Investigate actual scarcity vs. claimed scarcity\n\n**3. Social Proof Fabrication**\n• Pattern: Humans copy what others do\n• Manipulation: Fake testimonials, paid reviews, manufactured consensus\n• Example: '10,000 people already bought this!'\n• Defense: Seek independent verification of social proof claims\n\n**4. Authority Mimicry**\n• Pattern: Humans defer to perceived authority\n• Manipulation: Symbols of authority without actual expertise\n• Example: Doctors in lab coats selling products they know nothing about\n• Defense: Verify actual credentials and relevant expertise\n\n**5. Consistency Traps**\n• Pattern: Humans want to appear consistent\n• Manipulation: Small commitments that lead to large unwanted commitments\n• Example: 'You said you care about X, so you must do Y'\n• Defense: Right to change your mind based on new information\n\n**6. Liking Exploitation**\n• Pattern: Humans say yes to people they like\n• Manipulation: Manufactured rapport to gain compliance\n• Example: Sales training that teaches mirroring to create false connection\n• Defense: Separate liking someone from evaluating their proposal"

Manufactured Urgency**\n• Pattern: Create artificial time pressure\n• Example: 'Limited time offer', 'Only 2 left', flash sales\n• Why it works: Scarcity triggers immediate action\n• Design: Countdown timers, stock counters, exclusive access\n\n**Defending Your Attention**:\n1. **Recognize the pattern** ('This is variable reward conditioning')\n2. **Remove the trigger** (Turn off notifications, delete apps)\n3. **Add friction** (Use website blockers, time limits)\n4. **Conscious endpoints** ('I'll check 3 times today at scheduled times')\n5. **Alternative rewards** (Replace scroll with walk, read, create)"
