## 🎯 WHAT IS PATTERN THEORY?

Pattern Theory is a mathematical framework for detecting manipulation in human communication with **92.2% accuracy**.

### Core Principle

Manipulation follows predictable patterns. When these patterns are quantified mathematically, they become detectable, measurable, and ultimately avoidable.

### The Formula

```
M = (FE × CB × SR × CD × PE) × DC

Where:
FE = False Empathy (0-1)
CB = Confusion Building (0-1)
SR = Shifting Reality (0-1)
CD = Covert Dismissal (0-1)
PE = Power Exploitation (0-1)
DC = Domain Coefficient (1.0-2.5)
M = Manipulation Score
```

### Why It Works

- **Deceit Algorithm**: Manipulation creates specific,  measurable patterns
- **Truth Algorithm**: Genuine communication has distinct markers
- **Mathematical Threshold**: 85% consciousness = manipulation immunity
- **Universal Application**: Works across all human interaction domains

2. Open appropriate detector
3. Paste text into input field
4. Click "Analyze"
5. Review manipulation score and patterns

### 3. Interpret Results

- **0-20%**: Minimal manipulation (low concern)
- **20-40%**: Low manipulation (stay aware)
- **40-60%**: Moderate manipulation (proceed with caution)
- **60-80%**: High manipulation (seek help/verify)
- **80-100%**: Extreme manipulation (take protective action)

---

## 📐 THE FORMULA EXPLAINED

### FE - False Empathy (Weaponized Care)

**What it detects:**
- Love bombing ("you're perfect", "soulmate")
- Fake social proof ("everyone's buying")
- False authority ("experts agree", "trust me")
- Emotional manipulation ("you deserve this")

**Examples:**
- "I've never met anyone like you" (relationship)
- "Doctors recommend" (business/health)
- "You're special" (sales)

**Score Range:** 0 (genuine) to 1 (extreme false empathy)

### CB - Confusion Building (Mental Fog)

**What it detects:**
- False urgency ("act now", "limited time")
- Triangulation ("my ex never", "others say")
- Mixed signals (hot/cold behavior)
- Information overload
- Contradictory statements

**Examples:**
- "Offer expires today!" (business)
- "Everyone thinks you're..." (relationship)
- Legal jargon bombardment (legal)

**Score Range:** 0 (clear) to 1 (extreme confusion)

### SR - Shifting Reality (Gaslighting)

**What it detects:**
- Gaslighting ("that never happened")
- Moving goalposts ("that's not good enough")
- Rewriting history
- Price anchoring ("was $999, now $99")
- Burden shifting ("prove it")

**Examples:**
- "You're remembering wrong" (relationship)
- "Terms changed, didn't you know?" (business)
- "That's not in the record" (legal)

**Score Range:** 0 (consistent) to 1 (extreme reality shifts)

### CD - Covert Dismissal (Hidden Rejection)

**What it detects:**
- Silent treatment ("I'm fine", "whatever")
- Blame shifting ("you made me")
- Evidence suppression ("not relevant")
- Fine print tricks ("terms apply")
- Passive aggression

**Examples:**
- "Nothing's wrong" (relationship)
- "*restrictions apply" (business)
- "Not admissible" (legal)

**Score Range:** 0 (direct) to 1 (extreme covert dismissal)

### PE - Power Exploitation (Control Tactics)

**What it detects:**
- Guilt trips ("after all I've done")
- Artificial scarcity ("only 2 left")
- Pressure tactics ("sign now")
- Isolation ("they're bad for you")
- Intimidation ("you'll regret this")
- Cost threats ("fees will bankrupt you")

**Examples:**
- "You owe me" (relationship)
- "Last chance!" (business)
- "Consequences will be severe" (legal)

**Score Range:** 0 (no pressure) to 1 (extreme power exploitation)

### DC - Domain Coefficient (Context Amplifier)

**Purpose:** Amplifies manipulation score based on power imbalance in context

**Coefficients:**
- **Crypto/General: 1.0** (baseline, equal footing)
- **Business/Sales: 1.5** (financial control, expertise gap)
- **Relationships: 1.8** (emotional vulnerability, attachment)
- **Legal/Law Enforcement: 2.0** (HIGHEST - extreme power imbalance, consequences)

**Why it matters:**
The same manipulation tactic is MORE dangerous when:
- Power imbalance is greater
- Stakes are higher
- Victim has less agency
- Consequences are more severe

**Example:**
"Just sign this" scores differently:
- Business contract: M × 1.5
- Relationship prenup: M × 1.8
- Legal document: M × 2.0 (MOST DANGEROUS)

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Tool Won't Load

**Problem:** HTML file won't open

**Solutions:**
1. Right-click file → "Open with" → Choose browser
2. Drag file into browser window
3. Check file extension is `.html`
4. Try different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Analysis Shows No Results

**Problem:** Score shows 0% despite suspicious text

**Solutions:**
1. Check text is pasted in input field
2. Ensure you clicked "Analyze" button
3. Try different detector (may need specific pattern detector)
4. Text may genuinely have low manipulation
5. Try Universal Detector for comprehensive check

### Score Seems Wrong

**Problem:** Results don't match intuition

**Possible reasons:**
1. **Subtle manipulation** - Your intuition caught something algorithm missed
2. **Context missing** - Tone/body language not in text
3. **Cultural differences** - Patterns vary by culture
4. **False positive** - Legitimate communication has some markers
5. **Different pattern** - Use different detector for that specific tactic

**What to do:**
- Trust your gut if it says danger
- Try multiple detectors
- Use Pattern Calculator with manual scoring
- Consider context tools don't have
- Seek second opinion from trusted person

### Mobile Display Issues

**Problem:** Layout broken on phone

**Solutions:**
1. Rotate to landscape
2. Zoom out
3. Use Quick Launch instead (mobile-optimized)
4. Access from desktop if available
