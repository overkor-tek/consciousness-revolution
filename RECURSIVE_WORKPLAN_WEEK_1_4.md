## NEXT: RECURSIVE EXPANSION CONTINUES

**This document covers: Weeks 1-4 in EXTREME DETAIL**

**Next documents needed:**
- `RECURSIVE_WORKPLAN_WEEK_5_8.md` - Multi-computer expansion details
- `RECURSIVE_WORKPLAN_WEEK_9_13.md` - Screen watching and monitoring details
- And so on through Week 52...

**Philosophy:** Every high-level task recursively expands into:
1. Day-by-day breakdown
2. Hour-by-hour tasks (when critical)
3. Technical specifications
4. Dependencies
5. Validation criteria
6. Deliverables
7. Success metrics

**This is recursive boot-up protocol in action.** 🚀
