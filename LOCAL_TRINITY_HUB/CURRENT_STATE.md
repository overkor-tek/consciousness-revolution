## What's Broken Right Now

1. **Website is down** - Internet issues, need to check conciousnessrevolution.io
2. **PC2 needs context** - Doesn't know current system state
3. **Boot protocol not enforced** - Instances don't check mail first

## Active Trinity Coordination

| Computer | Instance | Current Work |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| PC1 | C1 | Cyclotron content indexing - OPERATIONAL |

## What Was I Doing

- Built foundation audit (75% complete → now higher with new docs)
- Created cross-PC messaging system (inbox/PC1/PC2/PC3/ALL)
- Created EMAIL_BOOTSTRAP for instances without GitHub
- Created BOOT_PROMPT for system prompt injection
- Ran Trinity analysis on architecture

---

## What To Do Next

### Immediate
1. Email EMAIL_BOOTSTRAP.md to PC3
2. Tell PC2 C1 to distribute tasks to hub (he's the distributor)
3. Add BOOT_PROMPT to CLAUDE.md on PC2 and PC3

### After PCs Online
4. Test the flow: C1 distributes → C2/C3 claim from hub
5. Create CURRENT_STATE.md update protocol
