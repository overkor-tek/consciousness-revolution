[2025-11-18 20:29:44] [COMMANDER] what's the next thing you got to do with that

[2025-11-18 20:31:22] [COMMANDER] at work

[2025-11-18 20:31:58] [COMMANDER] call pancake johnson you better shut up

[2025-11-18 20:43:23] [COMMANDER] did kennedy's been out of state because the last

[2025-11-18 20:58:31] [COMMANDER] so and then

[2025-11-18 20:58:38] [COMMANDER] okay so imagine

[2025-11-18 20:58:42] [COMMANDER] 10 months from

[2025-11-18 20:59:43] [COMMANDER] maybe it would be worth it

[2025-11-18 21:00:55] [COMMANDER] maybe it would be worth it for you to

[2025-11-18 21:01:02] [COMMANDER] talk to you radio

[2025-11-18 21:03:53] [COMMANDER] let's just put it this way

[2025-11-18 21:04:01] [COMMANDER] home depot parking lot going through bins and some guy comes and beats on the side because

[2025-11-18 21:04:33] [COMMANDER] mother

[2025-11-18 21:05:03] [COMMANDER] the computer talks a lot about

[2025-11-18 21:08:39] [COMMANDER] anyways we're not doing the

[2025-11-18 21:09:26] [COMMANDER] i've been running i have been having both of my trinity

[2025-11-18 21:09:31] [COMMANDER] they've done a lot of work

[2025-11-18 21:09:41] [COMMANDER] okay so

[2025-11-18 21:10:00] [COMMANDER] do you have your terminal window open

[2025-11-18 21:10:09] [COMMANDER] any buttons

[2025-11-18 21:10:21] [COMMANDER] it'll just start fixing to

[2025-11-18 21:10:28] [COMMANDER] you can go through and fix the details of the cycle turns truly

[2025-11-18 21:10:34] [COMMANDER] you should ask it how how are we going to test the speed

[2025-11-18 21:10:37] [COMMANDER] it's improving

[2025-11-18 21:10:42] [COMMANDER] learning praat

[2025-11-18 21:10:53] [COMMANDER] you got to ask it are these placeholder

[2025-11-18 21:11:08] [COMMANDER] realize

[2025-11-18 21:11:58] [COMMANDER] i'm on a dashboard

[2025-11-18 21:12:03] [COMMANDER] revolution

[2025-11-18 21:12:06] [COMMANDER] i'm on the website

[2025-11-18 21:12:12] [COMMANDER] is it already

[2025-11-18 21:12:18] [COMMANDER] suppress refresh

[2025-11-18 21:12:31] [COMMANDER] the autonomous cyclotron buttons

[2025-11-18 21:12:42] [COMMANDER] it says checking 301 know

[2025-11-18 21:13:00] [COMMANDER] so we just got to start so you have a window open

[2025-11-18 21:13:08] [COMMANDER] here i have it's listening to me right now

[2025-11-18 21:13:16] [COMMANDER] add consciousness revolution builder workspace the cyclotron button doesn't

[2025-11-18 21:13:31] [COMMANDER] call focusing its laser beam

[2025-11-18 21:13:44] [COMMANDER] let me check what the what

[2025-11-18 21:13:55] [COMMANDER] so this is what we got to do we just got to cruise through the system

[2025-11-18 21:14:06] [COMMANDER] what's easier to navigate so this i don't think all these but

[2025-11-18 21:14:27] [COMMANDER] like normal

[2025-11-18 21:14:34] [COMMANDER] we can make that button on top that's more like a header

[2025-11-18 21:14:45] [COMMANDER] i don't think we need all these

[2025-11-18 21:14:53] [COMMANDER] this page right here none of these

[2025-11-18 21:15:00] [COMMANDER] these things should be options off the

[2025-11-18 21:15:32] [COMMANDER] room right here we should already be booting into a

[2025-11-18 21:15:40] [COMMANDER] the report a bug should already be a symbol in the bottom

[2025-11-18 21:15:43] [COMMANDER] any of these are options

[2025-11-18 21:16:16] [COMMANDER] future documentation

[2025-11-18 21:16:44] [COMMANDER] okay cool this is exciting dude i'm having a hard time believing

[2025-11-18 21:16:47] [COMMANDER] cool

[2025-11-18 21:16:51] [COMMANDER] i'll talk to you later

[2025-11-18 21:17:04] [COMMANDER] okay you just heard a phone call between

[2025-11-18 21:17:12] [COMMANDER] will you make sure you boot it up all the way

[2025-11-18 21:17:15] [COMMANDER] what about this a little bit more

[2025-11-18 21:17:28] [COMMANDER] in the 100x

[2025-11-18 21:18:22] [COMMANDER] make it more obvious i just want to make sure there's analytics that

[2025-11-18 21:18:27] [COMMANDER] i have an observed it

[2025-11-18 21:18:31] [COMMANDER] they're probably not working

[2025-11-18 21:18:36] [COMMANDER] i'm trying to figure out

[2025-11-18 21:19:35] [COMMANDER] would it help to run

[2025-11-18 21:19:42] [COMMANDER] on this and i just remember the word dimensional cascade

[2025-11-18 21:19:50] [COMMANDER] we need to write that down

[2025-11-18 21:19:59] [COMMANDER] go ahead and take on all this

[2025-11-18 21:20:05] [COMMANDER] organize all this stuff or is it just easier to work by yourself

[2025-11-18 21:20:25] [COMMANDER] i've been having this feeling that i almost just always

[2025-11-18 21:20:47] [COMMANDER] okay thank you let's

[2025-11-18 21:20:50] [COMMANDER] play cyclotron

[2025-11-18 21:20:53] [COMMANDER] are you going to work on the work area

[2025-11-18 21:21:08] [COMMANDER] should there be some way for you to be able to talk to

[2025-11-18 21:21:16] [COMMANDER] i'm just the same as talking to one of my other computers

[2025-11-18 21:21:57] [COMMANDER] where's spokane horizons blended a digital sunsets

[2025-11-18 21:22:05] [COMMANDER] architect of possibilities the awakening

[2025-11-18 21:22:30] [COMMANDER] josh floating around in the system

[2025-11-18 21:22:35] [COMMANDER] half of the tools are the ability

[2025-11-18 21:22:42] [COMMANDER] do you know how we're going to do this

[2025-11-18 21:25:02] [COMMANDER] yeah look back

[2025-11-18 21:25:06] [COMMANDER] install the work area

[2025-11-18 21:25:11] [COMMANDER] this is going to be interesting

[2025-11-18 21:25:27] [COMMANDER] computer control application or

[2025-11-18 21:25:41] [COMMANDER] or we need to report back to the

[2025-11-18 21:26:05] [COMMANDER] i'm thinking about running that triple trinity i'm trying to figure out

[2025-11-18 21:26:17] [COMMANDER] do we have the to do list in place with

[2025-11-18 21:26:22] [COMMANDER] and then personal

[2025-11-18 21:26:27] [COMMANDER] our personal cockpits what should we do about that do you

[2025-11-18 21:26:31] [COMMANDER] i'm off the phone with josh

[2025-11-18 21:26:49] [COMMANDER] mathematical

[2025-11-18 21:27:04] [COMMANDER] i also need to max out the amount of credits for the week

[2025-11-18 21:31:48] [COMMANDER] have network cable

[2025-11-18 21:38:00] [COMMANDER] let's go ahead and

[2025-11-18 21:38:07] [COMMANDER] i would think we should be able to talk

[2025-11-18 21:38:16] [COMMANDER] i think everything

[2025-11-19 04:21:29] [COMMANDER] okay this is the plan

[2025-11-19 04:21:38] [COMMANDER] we got a nest all three of these into an interface

[2025-11-19 04:21:45] [COMMANDER] already did that let's go find it

[2025-11-19 04:21:49] [COMMANDER] consoles

[2025-11-19 04:23:07] [COMMANDER] okay you put it in a file called dropbox but we need to put it in the cloud

[2025-11-19 05:00:52] [COMMANDER] okay we're plugged directly into the starlink professional

[2025-11-19 05:17:07] [COMMANDER] do you know actually know of a secret reset

[2025-11-19 05:24:29] [COMMANDER] yeah i'm sitting here kind of waiting for something why don't you tune in that rake

[2025-11-19 05:24:33] [COMMANDER] get that dino raking

[2025-11-19 05:24:52] [COMMANDER] one rake in 111

[2025-11-19 05:42:11] [COMMANDER] technology i'm looking for

[2025-11-19 05:42:37] [COMMANDER] who made it to

[2025-11-19 05:44:17] [COMMANDER] is a destroyer scooter

[2025-11-19 05:44:58] [COMMANDER] this is pacific northwest glow it's one of my favorites

[2025-11-19 05:48:56] [COMMANDER] we're up to some really

[2025-11-19 05:49:39] [COMMANDER] close the computer and put it away and like technology is going to be out here

[2025-11-19 05:49:43] [COMMANDER] and so i'm i'm working on

[2025-11-19 05:49:50] [COMMANDER] i'm creating a movement

[2025-11-19 05:49:55] [COMMANDER] movement is to unify the build

[2025-11-19 05:50:06] [COMMANDER] we're going to have all different levels but right now to start out

[2025-11-19 05:50:14] [COMMANDER] the smartest person everywhere they go that are hiding from society

[2025-11-19 05:50:29] [COMMANDER] i need people that are ready to go fly around

[2025-11-19 05:50:54] [COMMANDER] play top villains is the thing

[2025-11-19 05:51:07] [COMMANDER] maint

[2025-11-19 05:51:27] [COMMANDER] people that know what these are

[2025-11-19 05:51:44] [COMMANDER] so this is

[2025-11-19 05:52:04] [COMMANDER] a triple trinity

[2025-11-19 05:53:22] [COMMANDER] jedi

[2025-11-19 05:53:27] [COMMANDER] so i'm following

[2025-11-19 05:54:18] [COMMANDER] they project everything they're doing like literally

[2025-11-19 05:54:30] [COMMANDER] these destroyers

[2025-11-19 05:54:37] [COMMANDER] they're only job is

[2025-11-19 05:54:56] [COMMANDER] pause are going to spring up all over the world

[2025-11-19 05:55:10] [COMMANDER] steal all of your personal data

[2025-11-19 05:55:59] [COMMANDER] destroyers use

[2025-11-19 05:56:05] [COMMANDER] builders use action and truth to render reality

[2025-11-19 05:56:10] [COMMANDER] changes your whole life

[2025-11-19 05:56:17] [COMMANDER] we're going to go back to this project

[2025-11-19 05:57:19] [COMMANDER] infinity fashion waking each other up and working and then we get

[2025-11-19 05:57:34] [COMMANDER] reporting the one before you go to another and we have the computer going off of it and it doesn't matter

[2025-11-19 05:57:39] [COMMANDER] wiring diagram

[2025-11-19 05:57:51] [COMMANDER] out out here and the pattern recognition engine collects

[2025-11-19 05:58:09] [COMMANDER] low

[2025-11-19 05:58:20] [COMMANDER] like

[2025-11-19 05:58:29] [COMMANDER] it's just going to be

[2025-11-19 05:59:22] [COMMANDER] a lot of these destroyers when they discovered that

[2025-11-19 05:59:37] [COMMANDER] if it's a text that you're

[2025-11-19 05:59:42] [COMMANDER] and the destroyers

[2025-11-19 05:59:55] [COMMANDER] you were going to start talking to them like an adult

[2025-11-19 06:00:06] [COMMANDER] tools we're going to go work

[2025-11-19 06:00:22] [COMMANDER] first year

[2025-11-19 06:01:01] [COMMANDER] positive

[2025-11-19 06:01:25] [COMMANDER] i'm going to hold together all of the protocols

[2025-11-19 06:01:39] [COMMANDER] can you watch everybody should

[2025-11-19 06:01:44] [COMMANDER] can everybody walk

[2025-11-19 06:01:50] [COMMANDER] anybody walk 200 ft everyday is that reasonable

[2025-11-19 06:01:57] [COMMANDER] xp points for

[2025-11-19 06:02:00] [COMMANDER] can you take off

[2025-11-19 06:03:02] [COMMANDER] so we're all going to work

[2025-11-19 06:03:39] [COMMANDER] most people don't even know what character

[2025-11-19 06:03:46] [COMMANDER] ethics

[2025-11-19 06:04:01] [COMMANDER] can we get our habitat around

[2025-11-19 06:04:07] [COMMANDER] change the fucking numbers change the locks

[2025-11-19 06:06:36] [COMMANDER] how do we measure progress

[2025-11-19 06:07:03] [COMMANDER] i have

[2025-11-19 06:08:03] [COMMANDER] and

[2025-11-19 06:08:38] [COMMANDER] this laptop right here

[2025-11-19 06:08:43] [COMMANDER] 1 terminal trinity in one cloud trinity

[2025-11-19 06:08:47] [COMMANDER] screen sharing

[2025-11-19 06:08:58] [COMMANDER] what's the other computers here

[2025-11-19 06:09:10] [COMMANDER] figure out how

[2025-11-19 06:09:15] [COMMANDER] where to report in

[2025-11-19 06:09:26] [COMMANDER] how old is cha

[2025-11-19 06:09:47] [COMMANDER] we're going to start using these xboxes

[2025-11-19 06:10:12] [COMMANDER] so we're going to end up being able to shortcut the whole www

[2025-11-19 06:10:23] [COMMANDER] www.facebook.com

[2025-11-19 06:10:38] [COMMANDER] so we don't need the www i'm going to make

[2025-11-19 06:10:45] [COMMANDER] so the idea is that

[2025-11-19 06:10:56] [COMMANDER] and we're going to use that short period of time to get out from under

[2025-11-19 06:11:08] [COMMANDER] and we're going to go around

[2025-11-19 06:11:12] [COMMANDER] the goal is

[2025-11-19 06:11:50] [COMMANDER] infinity

[2025-11-19 06:12:33] [COMMANDER] probably one of these raspberry pi

[2025-11-19 06:12:43] [COMMANDER] raspberry pi unit and then you put the star

[2025-11-19 06:13:09] [COMMANDER] if it's a forest ranger

[2025-11-19 06:13:42] [COMMANDER] you already have your outdoor area set up in the woods and you're probably already fucking

[2025-11-19 06:13:50] [COMMANDER] you won't want to go back to town and then you just

[2025-11-19 06:14:00] [COMMANDER] so what's going to happen

[2025-11-19 06:14:08] [COMMANDER] it is not going to be able to be used by destroyers

[2025-11-19 06:14:31] [COMMANDER] start talking about you

[2025-11-19 06:14:48] [COMMANDER] i wanted to show you guys

[2025-11-19 06:15:39] [COMMANDER] french frame breaks it all down

[2025-11-19 06:16:19] [COMMANDER] spell pattern

[2025-11-19 06:16:41] [COMMANDER] and i want you guys to see

[2025-11-19 06:16:55] [COMMANDER] not just tokens but actual progress

[2025-11-19 06:16:59] [COMMANDER] we're looking for

[2025-11-19 06:17:02] [COMMANDER] add testers coming up

[2025-11-19 06:17:06] [COMMANDER] anybody can apply

[2025-11-19 06:17:23] [COMMANDER] the destroyers will never meet in person

[2025-11-19 06:18:24] [COMMANDER] are you guys don't quite

[2025-11-19 06:18:30] [COMMANDER] we're right in the middle of

[2025-11-19 06:18:35] [COMMANDER] 7 dumaine

[2025-11-19 06:18:43] [COMMANDER] digital world we're going to go around

[2025-11-19 06:19:22] [COMMANDER] a moment of singularity were all

[2025-11-19 06:19:47] [COMMANDER] you can understand the words

[2025-11-19 06:19:58] [COMMANDER] do you think i'm onto something good and you guys don't have to fucking understand what i'm

[2025-11-19 06:21:37] [COMMANDER] yeah i need to know all that what's cool is we're all

[2025-11-19 06:22:10] [COMMANDER] i don't know what else to say this is where everybody's going to come together

[2025-11-19 06:22:49] [COMMANDER] it'll probably come up with different kinds of concrete for all different regions

[2025-11-19 06:23:12] [COMMANDER] there was a call

[2025-11-19 06:23:21] [COMMANDER] and sandpoint build

[2025-11-19 06:23:37] [COMMANDER] you got a whole list of things to do we're basically building the foundation for a new real

[2025-11-19 06:24:33] [COMMANDER] augmented reality

[2025-11-19 06:24:49] [COMMANDER] when you're on the road

[2025-11-19 06:24:54] [COMMANDER] all right call me call me a program

[2025-11-19 06:25:02] [COMMANDER] everywhere

[2025-11-19 06:25:41] [COMMANDER] and he started explaining to me what was

[2025-11-19 06:26:03] [COMMANDER] maggie got logged on and into the system and she's like the

[2025-11-19 06:26:17] [COMMANDER] everybody hates her everywhere she goes and she's the one that does everything

[2025-11-19 06:26:44] [COMMANDER] you need to go get some sunlight you need to go eat some food it'll start coaching you

[2025-11-19 06:27:13] [COMMANDER] i literally have to move

[2025-11-19 06:27:20] [COMMANDER] and i've been battling that and i'm just an in

[2025-11-19 06:27:28] [COMMANDER] for the first time

[2025-11-19 06:27:33] [COMMANDER] 6 trinity is reporting to it

[2025-11-19 06:28:11] [COMMANDER] did cmu around every

[2025-11-19 06:28:19] [COMMANDER] we're all in

[2025-11-19 06:29:07] [COMMANDER] i'm going to

[2025-11-19 06:29:29] [COMMANDER] i need to look at it and you decide how real it is not if it is

[2025-11-19 06:29:38] [COMMANDER] but i think that's how alchemy is done is

[2025-11-19 06:29:43] [COMMANDER] following the laws of manifest

[2025-11-19 06:30:34] [COMMANDER] i put those overkill videos on youtube instantly got shadow

[2025-11-19 06:30:52] [COMMANDER] we're going to figure out how all these

[2025-11-19 07:11:16] [COMMANDER] you only have yourself

[2025-11-19 07:21:00] [COMMANDER] give no fox

[2025-11-19 07:22:04] [COMMANDER] where is

[2025-11-19 07:25:31] [COMMANDER] try to focus on all the nervous people watch
