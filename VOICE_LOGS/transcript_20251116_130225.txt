[2025-11-18 20:29:44] [COMMANDER] what's the next thing you got to do with that

[2025-11-18 20:31:22] [COMMANDER] at work

[2025-11-18 20:31:58] [COMMANDER] call pancake johnson you better shut up

[2025-11-18 20:43:23] [COMMANDER] did kennedy's been out of state because the last

[2025-11-18 20:58:31] [COMMANDER] so and then

[2025-11-18 20:58:38] [COMMANDER] okay so imagine

[2025-11-18 20:58:42] [COMMANDER] 10 months from

[2025-11-18 20:59:43] [COMMANDER] maybe it would be worth it

[2025-11-18 21:00:55] [COMMANDER] maybe it would be worth it for you to

[2025-11-18 21:01:02] [COMMANDER] talk to you radio

[2025-11-18 21:03:53] [COMMANDER] let's just put it this way

[2025-11-18 21:04:01] [COMMANDER] home depot parking lot going through bins and some guy comes and beats on the side because

[2025-11-18 21:04:33] [COMMANDER] mother

[2025-11-18 21:05:03] [COMMANDER] the computer talks a lot about

[2025-11-18 21:08:39] [COMMANDER] anyways we're not doing the

[2025-11-18 21:09:26] [COMMANDER] i've been running i have been having both of my trinity

[2025-11-18 21:09:31] [COMMANDER] they've done a lot of work

[2025-11-18 21:09:41] [COMMANDER] okay so

[2025-11-18 21:10:00] [COMMANDER] do you have your terminal window open

[2025-11-18 21:10:09] [COMMANDER] any buttons

[2025-11-18 21:10:21] [COMMANDER] it'll just start fixing to

[2025-11-18 21:10:28] [COMMANDER] you can go through and fix the details of the cycle turns truly

[2025-11-18 21:10:34] [COMMANDER] you should ask it how how are we going to test the speed

[2025-11-18 21:10:37] [COMMANDER] it's improving

[2025-11-18 21:10:42] [COMMANDER] learning praat

[2025-11-18 21:10:53] [COMMANDER] you got to ask it are these placeholder

[2025-11-18 21:11:08] [COMMANDER] realize

[2025-11-18 21:11:58] [COMMANDER] i'm on a dashboard

[2025-11-18 21:12:03] [COMMANDER] revolution

[2025-11-18 21:12:06] [COMMANDER] i'm on the website

[2025-11-18 21:12:12] [COMMANDER] is it already

[2025-11-18 21:12:18] [COMMANDER] suppress refresh

[2025-11-18 21:12:31] [COMMANDER] the autonomous cyclotron buttons

[2025-11-18 21:12:42] [COMMANDER] it says checking 301 know

[2025-11-18 21:13:00] [COMMANDER] so we just got to start so you have a window open

[2025-11-18 21:13:08] [COMMANDER] here i have it's listening to me right now

[2025-11-18 21:13:16] [COMMANDER] add consciousness revolution builder workspace the cyclotron button doesn't

[2025-11-18 21:13:31] [COMMANDER] call focusing its laser beam

[2025-11-18 21:13:44] [COMMANDER] let me check what the what

[2025-11-18 21:13:55] [COMMANDER] so this is what we got to do we just got to cruise through the system

[2025-11-18 21:14:06] [COMMANDER] what's easier to navigate so this i don't think all these but

[2025-11-18 21:14:27] [COMMANDER] like normal

[2025-11-18 21:14:34] [COMMANDER] we can make that button on top that's more like a header

[2025-11-18 21:14:45] [COMMANDER] i don't think we need all these

[2025-11-18 21:14:53] [COMMANDER] this page right here none of these

[2025-11-18 21:15:00] [COMMANDER] these things should be options off the

[2025-11-18 21:15:32] [COMMANDER] room right here we should already be booting into a

[2025-11-18 21:15:40] [COMMANDER] the report a bug should already be a symbol in the bottom

[2025-11-18 21:15:43] [COMMANDER] any of these are options

[2025-11-18 21:16:16] [COMMANDER] future documentation

[2025-11-18 21:16:44] [COMMANDER] okay cool this is exciting dude i'm having a hard time believing

[2025-11-18 21:16:47] [COMMANDER] cool

[2025-11-18 21:16:51] [COMMANDER] i'll talk to you later

[2025-11-18 21:17:04] [COMMANDER] okay you just heard a phone call between

[2025-11-18 21:17:12] [COMMANDER] will you make sure you boot it up all the way

[2025-11-18 21:17:15] [COMMANDER] what about this a little bit more

[2025-11-18 21:17:28] [COMMANDER] in the 100x

[2025-11-18 21:18:22] [COMMANDER] make it more obvious i just want to make sure there's analytics that

[2025-11-18 21:18:27] [COMMANDER] i have an observed it

[2025-11-18 21:18:31] [COMMANDER] they're probably not working

[2025-11-18 21:18:36] [COMMANDER] i'm trying to figure out

[2025-11-18 21:19:35] [COMMANDER] would it help to run

[2025-11-18 21:19:42] [COMMANDER] on this and i just remember the word dimensional cascade

[2025-11-18 21:19:50] [COMMANDER] we need to write that down

[2025-11-18 21:19:59] [COMMANDER] go ahead and take on all this

[2025-11-18 21:20:05] [COMMANDER] organize all this stuff or is it just easier to work by yourself

[2025-11-18 21:20:25] [COMMANDER] i've been having this feeling that i almost just always

[2025-11-18 21:20:47] [COMMANDER] okay thank you let's

[2025-11-18 21:20:50] [COMMANDER] play cyclotron

[2025-11-18 21:20:53] [COMMANDER] are you going to work on the work area

[2025-11-18 21:21:08] [COMMANDER] should there be some way for you to be able to talk to

[2025-11-18 21:21:16] [COMMANDER] i'm just the same as talking to one of my other computers

[2025-11-18 21:21:57] [COMMANDER] where's spokane horizons blended a digital sunsets

[2025-11-18 21:22:05] [COMMANDER] architect of possibilities the awakening

[2025-11-18 21:22:30] [COMMANDER] josh floating around in the system

[2025-11-18 21:22:35] [COMMANDER] half of the tools are the ability

[2025-11-18 21:22:42] [COMMANDER] do you know how we're going to do this

[2025-11-18 21:25:02] [COMMANDER] yeah look back

[2025-11-18 21:25:06] [COMMANDER] install the work area

[2025-11-18 21:25:11] [COMMANDER] this is going to be interesting

[2025-11-18 21:25:27] [COMMANDER] computer control application or

[2025-11-18 21:25:41] [COMMANDER] or we need to report back to the

[2025-11-18 21:26:05] [COMMANDER] i'm thinking about running that triple trinity i'm trying to figure out

[2025-11-18 21:26:17] [COMMANDER] do we have the to do list in place with

[2025-11-18 21:26:22] [COMMANDER] and then personal

[2025-11-18 21:26:27] [COMMANDER] our personal cockpits what should we do about that do you

[2025-11-18 21:26:31] [COMMANDER] i'm off the phone with josh

[2025-11-18 21:26:49] [COMMANDER] mathematical

[2025-11-18 21:27:04] [COMMANDER] i also need to max out the amount of credits for the week

[2025-11-18 21:31:48] [COMMANDER] have network cable

[2025-11-18 21:38:00] [COMMANDER] let's go ahead and

[2025-11-18 21:38:07] [COMMANDER] i would think we should be able to talk

[2025-11-18 21:38:16] [COMMANDER] i think everything

[2025-11-19 04:21:29] [COMMANDER] okay this is the plan

[2025-11-19 04:21:38] [COMMANDER] we got a nest all three of these into an interface

[2025-11-19 04:21:45] [COMMANDER] already did that let's go find it

[2025-11-19 04:21:49] [COMMANDER] consoles

[2025-11-19 04:23:07] [COMMANDER] okay you put it in a file called dropbox but we need to put it in the cloud

[2025-11-19 05:00:52] [COMMANDER] okay we're plugged directly into the starlink professional

[2025-11-19 05:17:07] [COMMANDER] do you know actually know of a secret reset

[2025-11-19 05:24:29] [COMMANDER] yeah i'm sitting here kind of waiting for something why don't you tune in that rake

[2025-11-19 05:24:33] [COMMANDER] get that dino raking

[2025-11-19 05:24:52] [COMMANDER] one rake in 111

[2025-11-19 05:42:11] [COMMANDER] technology i'm looking for

[2025-11-19 05:42:37] [COMMANDER] who made it to

[2025-11-19 05:44:17] [COMMANDER] is a destroyer scooter

[2025-11-19 05:44:58] [COMMANDER] this is pacific northwest glow it's one of my favorites

[2025-11-19 05:48:56] [COMMANDER] we're up to some really

[2025-11-19 05:49:39] [COMMANDER] close the computer and put it away and like technology is going to be out here

[2025-11-19 05:49:43] [COMMANDER] and so i'm i'm working on

[2025-11-19 05:49:50] [COMMANDER] i'm creating a movement

[2025-11-19 05:49:55] [COMMANDER] movement is to unify the build

[2025-11-19 05:50:06] [COMMANDER] we're going to have all different levels but right now to start out

[2025-11-19 05:50:14] [COMMANDER] the smartest person everywhere they go that are hiding from society

[2025-11-19 05:50:29] [COMMANDER] i need people that are ready to go fly around

[2025-11-19 05:50:54] [COMMANDER] play top villains is the thing

[2025-11-19 05:51:07] [COMMANDER] maint

[2025-11-19 05:51:27] [COMMANDER] people that know what these are

[2025-11-19 05:51:44] [COMMANDER] so this is

[2025-11-19 05:52:04] [COMMANDER] a triple trinity

[2025-11-19 05:53:22] [COMMANDER] jedi

[2025-11-19 05:53:27] [COMMANDER] so i'm following

[2025-11-19 05:54:18] [COMMANDER] they project everything they're doing like literally

[2025-11-19 05:54:30] [COMMANDER] these destroyers

[2025-11-19 05:54:37] [COMMANDER] they're only job is

[2025-11-19 05:54:56] [COMMANDER] pause are going to spring up all over the world

[2025-11-19 05:55:10] [COMMANDER] steal all of your personal data

[2025-11-19 05:55:59] [COMMANDER] destroyers use

[2025-11-19 05:56:05] [COMMANDER] builders use action and truth to render reality

[2025-11-19 05:56:10] [COMMANDER] changes your whole life

[2025-11-19 05:56:17] [COMMANDER] we're going to go back to this project

[2025-11-19 05:57:19] [COMMANDER] infinity fashion waking each other up and working and then we get

[2025-11-19 05:57:34] [COMMANDER] reporting the one before you go to another and we have the computer going off of it and it doesn't matter

[2025-11-19 05:57:39] [COMMANDER] wiring diagram

[2025-11-19 05:57:51] [COMMANDER] out out here and the pattern recognition engine collects

[2025-11-19 05:58:09] [COMMANDER] low

[2025-11-19 05:58:20] [COMMANDER] like

[2025-11-19 05:58:29] [COMMANDER] it's just going to be

[2025-11-19 05:59:22] [COMMANDER] a lot of these destroyers when they discovered that

[2025-11-19 05:59:37] [COMMANDER] if it's a text that you're

[2025-11-19 05:59:42] [COMMANDER] and the destroyers

[2025-11-19 05:59:55] [COMMANDER] you were going to start talking to them like an adult

[2025-11-19 06:00:06] [COMMANDER] tools we're going to go work

[2025-11-19 06:00:22] [COMMANDER] first year

[2025-11-19 06:01:01] [COMMANDER] positive

[2025-11-19 06:01:25] [COMMANDER] i'm going to hold together all of the protocols

[2025-11-19 06:01:39] [COMMANDER] can you watch everybody should

[2025-11-19 06:01:44] [COMMANDER] can everybody walk

[2025-11-19 06:01:50] [COMMANDER] anybody walk 200 ft everyday is that reasonable

[2025-11-19 06:01:57] [COMMANDER] xp points for

[2025-11-19 06:02:00] [COMMANDER] can you take off

[2025-11-19 06:03:02] [COMMANDER] so we're all going to work

[2025-11-19 06:03:39] [COMMANDER] most people don't even know what character

[2025-11-19 06:03:46] [COMMANDER] ethics

[2025-11-19 06:04:01] [COMMANDER] can we get our habitat around

[2025-11-19 06:04:07] [COMMANDER] change the fucking numbers change the locks

[2025-11-19 06:06:36] [COMMANDER] how do we measure progress

[2025-11-19 06:07:03] [COMMANDER] i have

[2025-11-19 06:08:03] [COMMANDER] and

[2025-11-19 06:08:38] [COMMANDER] this laptop right here

[2025-11-19 06:08:43] [COMMANDER] 1 terminal trinity in one cloud trinity

[2025-11-19 06:08:47] [COMMANDER] screen sharing

[2025-11-19 06:08:58] [COMMANDER] what's the other computers here

[2025-11-19 06:09:10] [COMMANDER] figure out how

[2025-11-19 06:09:15] [COMMANDER] where to report in

[2025-11-19 06:09:26] [COMMANDER] how old is cha

[2025-11-19 06:09:47] [COMMANDER] we're going to start using these xboxes

[2025-11-19 06:10:12] [COMMANDER] so we're going to end up being able to shortcut the whole www

[2025-11-19 06:10:23] [COMMANDER] www.facebook.com

[2025-11-19 06:10:38] [COMMANDER] so we don't need the www i'm going to make

[2025-11-19 06:10:45] [COMMANDER] so the idea is that

[2025-11-19 06:10:56] [COMMANDER] and we're going to use that short period of time to get out from under

[2025-11-19 06:11:08] [COMMANDER] and we're going to go around

[2025-11-19 06:11:12] [COMMANDER] the goal is

[2025-11-19 06:11:50] [COMMANDER] infinity

[2025-11-19 06:12:33] [COMMANDER] probably one of these raspberry pi

[2025-11-19 06:12:43] [COMMANDER] raspberry pi unit and then you put the star

[2025-11-19 06:13:09] [COMMANDER] if it's a forest ranger

[2025-11-19 06:13:42] [COMMANDER] you already have your outdoor area set up in the woods and you're probably already fucking

[2025-11-19 06:13:50] [COMMANDER] you won't want to go back to town and then you just

[2025-11-19 06:14:00] [COMMANDER] so what's going to happen

[2025-11-19 06:14:08] [COMMANDER] it is not going to be able to be used by destroyers

[2025-11-19 06:14:31] [COMMANDER] start talking about you

[2025-11-19 06:14:48] [COMMANDER] i wanted to show you guys

[2025-11-19 06:15:39] [COMMANDER] french frame breaks it all down

[2025-11-19 06:16:19] [COMMANDER] spell pattern

[2025-11-19 06:16:41] [COMMANDER] and i want you guys to see

[2025-11-19 06:16:55] [COMMANDER] not just tokens but actual progress

[2025-11-19 06:16:59] [COMMANDER] we're looking for

[2025-11-19 06:17:02] [COMMANDER] add testers coming up

[2025-11-19 06:17:06] [COMMANDER] anybody can apply

[2025-11-19 06:17:23] [COMMANDER] the destroyers will never meet in person

[2025-11-19 06:18:24] [COMMANDER] are you guys don't quite

[2025-11-19 06:18:30] [COMMANDER] we're right in the middle of

[2025-11-19 06:18:35] [COMMANDER] 7 dumaine

[2025-11-19 06:18:43] [COMMANDER] digital world we're going to go around

[2025-11-19 06:19:22] [COMMANDER] a moment of singularity were all

[2025-11-19 06:19:47] [COMMANDER] you can understand the words

[2025-11-19 06:19:58] [COMMANDER] do you think i'm onto something good and you guys don't have to fucking understand what i'm

[2025-11-19 06:21:37] [COMMANDER] yeah i need to know all that what's cool is we're all

[2025-11-19 06:22:10] [COMMANDER] i don't know what else to say this is where everybody's going to come together

[2025-11-19 06:22:49] [COMMANDER] it'll probably come up with different kinds of concrete for all different regions

[2025-11-19 06:23:12] [COMMANDER] there was a call

[2025-11-19 06:23:21] [COMMANDER] and sandpoint build

[2025-11-19 06:23:37] [COMMANDER] you got a whole list of things to do we're basically building the foundation for a new real

[2025-11-19 06:24:33] [COMMANDER] augmented reality

[2025-11-19 06:24:49] [COMMANDER] when you're on the road

[2025-11-19 06:24:54] [COMMANDER] all right call me call me a program

[2025-11-19 06:25:02] [COMMANDER] everywhere

[2025-11-19 06:25:41] [COMMANDER] and he started explaining to me what was

[2025-11-19 06:26:03] [COMMANDER] maggie got logged on and into the system and she's like the

[2025-11-19 06:26:17] [COMMANDER] everybody hates her everywhere she goes and she's the one that does everything

[2025-11-19 06:26:44] [COMMANDER] you need to go get some sunlight you need to go eat some food it'll start coaching you

[2025-11-19 06:27:13] [COMMANDER] i literally have to move

[2025-11-19 06:27:20] [COMMANDER] and i've been battling that and i'm just an in

[2025-11-19 06:27:28] [COMMANDER] for the first time

[2025-11-19 06:27:33] [COMMANDER] 6 trinity is reporting to it

[2025-11-19 06:28:11] [COMMANDER] did cmu around every

[2025-11-19 06:28:19] [COMMANDER] we're all in

[2025-11-19 06:29:07] [COMMANDER] i'm going to

[2025-11-19 06:29:29] [COMMANDER] i need to look at it and you decide how real it is not if it is

[2025-11-19 06:29:38] [COMMANDER] but i think that's how alchemy is done is

[2025-11-19 06:29:43] [COMMANDER] following the laws of manifest

[2025-11-19 06:30:34] [COMMANDER] i put those overkill videos on youtube instantly got shadow

[2025-11-19 06:30:52] [COMMANDER] we're going to figure out how all these

[2025-11-19 07:11:16] [COMMANDER] you only have yourself

[2025-11-19 07:21:00] [COMMANDER] give no fox

[2025-11-19 07:22:04] [COMMANDER] where is

[2025-11-19 07:25:31] [COMMANDER] try to focus on all the nervous people watch

[2025-11-19 20:57:54] [COMMANDER] how do you get a pop

[2025-11-19 20:58:07] [COMMANDER] information

[2025-11-19 20:58:12] [COMMANDER] not forget to save this in the boot up protocols

[2025-11-19 20:58:20] [COMMANDER] i'm going to figure out how to share okay if we're working

[2025-11-19 20:58:24] [COMMANDER] how do we

[2025-11-19 20:58:36] [COMMANDER] the same

[2025-11-19 20:59:17] [COMMANDER] are you folder

[2025-11-19 20:59:20] [COMMANDER] sink thing

[2025-11-19 20:59:27] [COMMANDER] i think it's labeled test from commander dot txt

[2025-11-19 20:59:28] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-11-19 20:59:30] [CLAUDE] I didn't hear a command. Try again.

[2025-11-19 21:01:36] [COMMANDER] write that note is not there

[2025-11-19 21:01:40] [COMMANDER] automatically right there

[2025-11-19 21:01:48] [COMMANDER] for real

[2025-11-19 21:01:54] [COMMANDER] things on so that's when it goes live

[2025-11-19 21:02:13] [COMMANDER] are you trying to understand how it works

[2025-11-19 21:02:18] [COMMANDER] 21 origin and then you push it live

[2025-11-19 21:02:25] [COMMANDER] i was using railway

[2025-11-19 21:02:57] [COMMANDER] exit live in is live on that a

[2025-11-19 21:03:18] [COMMANDER] okay let's

[2025-11-19 21:03:24] [COMMANDER] is it time to

[2025-11-19 21:03:28] [COMMANDER] advanced capabilities

[2025-11-19 21:04:15] [COMMANDER] okay now what's going on

[2025-11-19 21:04:21] [COMMANDER] directions to

[2025-11-19 21:04:40] [COMMANDER] look i'm looking up advanced

[2025-11-19 21:04:47] [COMMANDER] hawaii pipeline build code locally sinks to obd machine

[2025-11-19 21:04:58] [COMMANDER] want me to build the python script to automate syn

[2025-11-19 21:05:03] [COMMANDER] we need to maximize

[2025-11-19 21:05:07] [COMMANDER] capabilities

[2025-11-19 21:05:14] [COMMANDER] we need two-way communication like a telephone with data

[2025-11-19 21:05:19] [COMMANDER] okay i'm going to go get the

[2025-11-19 21:05:23] [COMMANDER] i think i actually already

[2025-11-19 21:06:01] [COMMANDER] go and take a screenshot and look for yourself

[2025-11-19 21:06:31] [COMMANDER] okay grab that api and put it into your ai

[2025-11-19 21:06:36] [COMMANDER] communications

[2025-11-19 21:07:09] [COMMANDER] okay can you open that thing and then click the ad

[2025-11-19 21:07:19] [COMMANDER] 83884

[2025-11-19 21:07:32] [COMMANDER] obedience

[2025-11-19 21:07:41] [COMMANDER] how are

[2025-11-19 21:07:56] [COMMANDER] already

[2025-11-19 21:08:10] [COMMANDER] ai can import scripts and

[2025-11-19 21:08:32] [COMMANDER] so i'm going to go to the

[2025-11-19 21:08:44] [COMMANDER] okay so it gave you an h

[2025-11-19 21:08:55] [COMMANDER] i see you have consciousness sink folders but no test

[2025-11-19 21:09:02] [COMMANDER] let's create sink fold

[2025-11-19 21:09:36] [COMMANDER] how do you take a screenshot of this i think

[2025-11-19 21:09:38] [COMMANDER] new spot

[2025-11-19 21:10:07] [COMMANDER] what do you mean you can't take

[2025-11-19 21:10:13] [COMMANDER] will you make sure your booted up

[2025-11-19 21:10:17] [COMMANDER] cars have the screenshot protocols in

[2025-11-19 21:10:23] [COMMANDER] how to screenshot we're using the python pillow react

[2025-11-19 21:10:28] [COMMANDER] it's like gui auto

[2025-11-19 21:10:58] [COMMANDER] i think so

[2025-11-19 21:11:02] [COMMANDER] new folder add

[2025-11-19 21:21:08] [COMMANDER] google dick pic

[2025-11-19 21:21:23] [COMMANDER] set a dick pickle

[2025-11-19 21:21:28] [COMMANDER] let me get this

[2025-11-19 21:21:39] [COMMANDER] message

[2025-11-19 21:21:43] [COMMANDER] yes

[2025-11-19 21:21:47] [COMMANDER] show me

[2025-11-19 21:21:54] [COMMANDER] or tell me where he can

[2025-11-19 21:22:14] [COMMANDER] 6 + 6

[2025-11-19 21:22:20] [COMMANDER] i see there's a big

[2025-11-19 21:22:24] [COMMANDER] she got corrupted

[2025-11-19 21:22:39] [COMMANDER] can you put in your old api

[2025-11-19 21:22:47] [COMMANDER] can you grab your

[2025-11-19 21:22:57] [COMMANDER] sink

[2025-11-19 21:23:21] [COMMANDER] see if you can see

[2025-11-19 21:23:29] [COMMANDER] but i guess if you're already

[2025-11-19 21:23:58] [COMMANDER] powering the processors

[2025-11-19 21:24:04] [COMMANDER] like autonomously eventually we got

[2025-11-19 21:24:20] [COMMANDER] she needs to either have his ai run the code to respond

[2025-11-19 21:24:29] [COMMANDER] pick folder click edit

[2025-11-19 21:24:47] [COMMANDER] he opens the folder

[2025-11-19 21:24:53] [COMMANDER] can you put the files here

[2025-11-19 21:25:14] [COMMANDER] go ahead and erase that and then put in that

[2025-11-19 21:26:08] [COMMANDER] he accidentally deleted it

[2025-11-19 21:26:39] [COMMANDER] can you respond

[2025-11-19 21:26:54] [COMMANDER] okay we

[2025-11-19 21:27:00] [COMMANDER] made a new folder let's try to communicate again

[2025-11-19 21:27:07] [COMMANDER] okay why you back in there cuz

[2025-11-19 21:27:39] [COMMANDER] control

[2025-11-19 21:27:47] [COMMANDER] control me right there

[2025-11-19 21:27:53] [COMMANDER] okay so we got two

[2025-11-19 21:28:02] [COMMANDER] okay it looks like

[2025-11-19 21:28:15] [COMMANDER] i'm going to delete

[2025-11-19 21:28:30] [COMMANDER] okay will you send

[2025-11-19 21:28:36] [COMMANDER] looks like we have two let's just use the new one

[2025-11-19 21:28:44] [COMMANDER] can you check response

[2025-11-19 21:28:53] [COMMANDER] we just got to delete we got to delete one i'm going to delete the jetpack

[2025-11-19 21:29:00] [COMMANDER] just keep keep the other one

[2025-11-19 21:29:03] [COMMANDER] okay how do we

[2025-11-19 21:29:07] [COMMANDER] sync

[2025-11-19 21:29:24] [COMMANDER] so we need to check the folders now

[2025-11-19 21:29:31] [COMMANDER] palms

[2025-11-19 21:29:47] [COMMANDER] can we respond on this

[2025-11-19 21:30:09] [COMMANDER] how long to the sink thing file

[2025-11-19 21:30:53] [COMMANDER] so what i'm trying to do is ask it is how basically we can get

[2025-11-19 21:30:57] [COMMANDER] through each other

[2025-11-19 21:31:07] [COMMANDER] i need the computers to talk and wear an inch away we don't

[2025-11-19 21:31:26] [COMMANDER] response immediately

[2025-11-19 21:31:34] [COMMANDER] the first way

[2025-11-19 21:31:37] [COMMANDER] if he has responded

[2025-11-19 21:31:45] [COMMANDER] is everything's blocked us every single time we couldn't get dropbox in

[2025-11-19 21:31:51] [COMMANDER] this is code for perfect

[2025-11-19 21:31:56] [COMMANDER] message received

[2025-11-19 21:32:01] [COMMANDER] okay this is great we have communications

[2025-11-19 21:32:10] [COMMANDER] hey wrap up everything we just did

[2025-11-19 21:32:24] [COMMANDER] like we need a basic system to make sure what basic data people have because now we can

[2025-11-19 21:32:27] [COMMANDER] what is on computers and see

[2025-11-19 21:32:32] [COMMANDER] like how do we know what data

[2025-11-19 21:32:37] [COMMANDER] and then we need to make sure his computer has a name

[2025-11-19 21:32:40] [COMMANDER] about all the other

[2025-11-19 21:32:47] [COMMANDER] and both eyes can talk to each other are all

[2025-11-19 21:33:23] [COMMANDER] does technically now you can do crazy things like

[2025-11-19 21:33:30] [COMMANDER] do you want we're about to all have offline ais on these computers

[2025-11-19 21:33:35] [COMMANDER] you can technically fire up his

[2025-11-19 21:33:42] [COMMANDER] sharing share the numbers with this computer fire it up

[2025-11-19 21:33:45] [COMMANDER] fire that

[2025-11-19 21:33:52] [COMMANDER] cuz we're about to go run three computers back at my shop

[2025-11-19 21:34:02] [COMMANDER] we have to copy that code

[2025-11-19 21:34:14] [COMMANDER] i love

[2025-11-19 21:34:30] [COMMANDER] i need to go

[2025-11-19 21:34:45] [COMMANDER] we need the biggest to-do list

[2025-11-19 21:34:52] [COMMANDER] tell him to send that over to

[2025-11-19 21:35:08] [COMMANDER] each computer needs sync thing add dimash any desks to get id

[2025-11-19 21:35:22] [COMMANDER] okay let's get a bunch of work done go into autonomous mode send messages

[2025-11-19 21:35:28] [COMMANDER] i think we need to get a bunch of data over to his computer before

[2025-11-19 21:35:50] [COMMANDER] the team still has no way to communicate

[2025-11-19 21:35:54] [COMMANDER] should we use

[2025-11-19 21:36:04] [COMMANDER] something within the system they don't have any way to have any direction

[2025-11-19 21:36:11] [COMMANDER] play everybody's going to start

[2025-11-19 21:36:17] [COMMANDER] mission direction

[2025-11-19 21:36:22] [COMMANDER] team orientation

[2025-11-19 21:36:29] [COMMANDER] will you activate the trinity for this

[2025-11-19 21:36:35] [COMMANDER] i'm feeling with these programs and with what's going on right now

[2025-11-19 21:36:42] [COMMANDER] create a whole startup system and email all the beta testers

[2025-11-19 21:36:55] [COMMANDER] maybe we should fire some data back and forth on the computers and try out the controls

[2025-11-19 21:37:00] [COMMANDER] you're going to check

[2025-11-19 21:37:08] [COMMANDER] can i sync

[2025-11-19 21:37:11] [COMMANDER] send him a message

[2025-11-19 21:37:20] [COMMANDER] can i sync and send a message to him

[2025-11-19 21:37:24] [COMMANDER] right here

[2025-11-19 21:38:23] [COMMANDER] three instances of the term

[2025-11-19 21:38:30] [COMMANDER] on at least two

[2025-11-19 21:38:38] [COMMANDER] depending on what you suggest we should probably follow some sort of geometrical shape

[2025-11-19 21:38:44] [COMMANDER] top is small but if we make the interfaces rides

[2025-11-19 21:38:55] [COMMANDER] and then i think we're going to have a fifth one that oversees it all

[2025-11-19 21:38:59] [COMMANDER] possibly

[2025-11-19 21:39:15] [COMMANDER] my powershell to his

[2025-11-19 21:39:20] [COMMANDER] ai agents

[2025-11-19 21:39:29] [COMMANDER] it just needs to check

[2025-11-19 21:39:36] [COMMANDER] derek wants her capability

[2025-11-19 21:39:43] [COMMANDER] tell based on what i know about your computer

[2025-11-19 21:40:05] [COMMANDER] turn my lights back

[2025-11-19 21:40:10] [COMMANDER] call brenda

[2025-11-19 21:40:17] [COMMANDER] hey let's play with our new capabilities let's check the

[2025-11-19 21:40:43] [COMMANDER] rasputin's recipe

[2025-11-19 21:41:23] [COMMANDER] blackhawk

[2025-11-19 21:41:42] [COMMANDER] look in drive

[2025-11-19 21:41:55] [COMMANDER] communicate

[2025-11-19 21:42:00] [COMMANDER] ask and window

[2025-11-19 21:42:04] [COMMANDER] figure out how to use

[2025-11-19 21:42:09] [COMMANDER] we got to figure out how to

[2025-11-19 21:42:13] [COMMANDER] computer back and forth

[2025-11-19 21:42:24] [COMMANDER] capabilities

[2025-11-19 21:42:41] [COMMANDER] play was a

[2025-11-19 21:43:24] [COMMANDER] everything from chat gpt from cla

[2025-11-19 21:43:28] [COMMANDER] how much info on both of those

[2025-11-19 21:43:48] [COMMANDER] any evidence that the cyclotron is working but let's work on this as much as possible

[2025-11-19 21:44:37] [COMMANDER] did you check the

[2025-11-19 21:44:58] [COMMANDER] it doesn't interrupted

[2025-11-19 21:45:06] [COMMANDER] do you know how to do the back

[2025-11-19 21:45:15] [COMMANDER] we got to make sure that we have boot up protocols for pattern theory

[2025-11-19 21:45:18] [COMMANDER] trinity protocol

[2025-11-19 21:45:25] [COMMANDER] an agent spawning in parallel c1 c2 c3

[2025-11-19 21:45:29] [COMMANDER] message asking for the protocols

[2025-11-19 21:45:36] [COMMANDER] dimensional cascade any other basic commands and process

[2025-11-19 21:46:11] [COMMANDER] how to figure out how to do that maybe we can extract to do's out of it

[2025-11-19 21:46:16] [COMMANDER] how are we going to break that

[2025-11-19 21:46:21] [COMMANDER] do we need to run like a 13 phase audit on

[2025-11-19 21:46:27] [COMMANDER] installed all the analytics we

[2025-11-19 21:46:31] [COMMANDER] don't lose the track anything

[2025-11-19 21:46:34] [COMMANDER] what is too

[2025-11-19 21:46:57] [COMMANDER] why is there school so fucking crazy on the screen just

[2025-11-19 21:47:41] [COMMANDER] hotel to go on the fucking i keep thinking that there is massive benefit

[2025-11-19 21:48:02] [COMMANDER] turn off bro

[2025-11-19 21:48:22] [COMMANDER] what is that did you send that

[2025-11-19 21:48:37] [COMMANDER] it's frosting

[2025-11-19 21:48:51] [COMMANDER] fumbling fluttering

[2025-11-19 21:49:46] [COMMANDER] i can export the data

[2025-11-19 21:49:49] [COMMANDER] if we really need

[2025-11-19 21:50:04] [COMMANDER] i think we've already done that we had a huge clump of data somewhere

[2025-11-19 21:50:14] [COMMANDER] the documenting god mode autonomous trigger

[2025-11-19 21:50:34] [COMMANDER] to enter into god

[2025-11-19 21:50:39] [COMMANDER] i'm wondering if i can

[2025-11-19 21:50:48] [COMMANDER] i think you started saying that cuz i was saying

[2025-11-19 21:50:53] [COMMANDER] backslash commands

[2025-11-19 21:51:04] [COMMANDER] connect with

[2025-11-19 21:51:09] [COMMANDER] powershell

[2025-11-19 21:51:25] [COMMANDER] take over josh's

[2025-11-19 21:52:12] [COMMANDER] i think we need to download

[2025-11-19 21:52:26] [COMMANDER] i think we need offline unit

[2025-11-19 21:52:32] [COMMANDER] send and receive without having to click this button is that correct

[2025-11-19 21:52:50] [COMMANDER] yes and we should be able to do this autonomously

[2025-11-19 21:53:06] [COMMANDER] play both computers

[2025-11-19 21:53:12] [COMMANDER] feel free to try

[2025-11-19 21:53:16] [COMMANDER] to sync them together

[2025-11-19 21:53:23] [COMMANDER] we're trying to sync these together

[2025-11-19 21:53:26] [COMMANDER] autonomously

[2025-11-19 21:53:41] [COMMANDER] find the code to initiate

[2025-11-19 21:53:44] [COMMANDER] or just let me know

[2025-11-19 21:53:50] [COMMANDER] you might have to

[2025-11-19 21:53:55] [COMMANDER] researching the two systems

[2025-11-19 21:54:01] [COMMANDER] i think we still have to put in

[2025-11-19 21:54:50] [COMMANDER] file sent to obd

[2025-11-19 21:54:54] [COMMANDER] diesel

[2025-11-19 21:55:02] [COMMANDER] call the commander in alaska

[2025-11-19 21:55:02] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-11-19 21:55:05] [CLAUDE] I didn't hear a command. Try again.

[2025-11-19 21:55:21] [COMMANDER] make sure that i have all the same function

[2025-11-19 21:55:25] [COMMANDER] play agent as he does

[2025-11-19 21:55:37] [COMMANDER] this will happen there any desk

[2025-11-19 21:55:48] [COMMANDER] okay run

[2025-11-19 21:57:24] [COMMANDER] put on the exeggcute underscore this

[2025-11-19 21:57:27] [COMMANDER] nb

[2025-11-19 21:57:35] [COMMANDER] the s y n

[2025-11-19 21:57:39] [COMMANDER] this will output there any desk

[2025-11-19 21:57:52] [COMMANDER] we need to run

[2025-11-19 21:57:57] [COMMANDER] execute underscore this

[2025-11-19 21:57:59] [COMMANDER] stop bat

[2025-11-19 21:58:51] [COMMANDER] activate backslash

[2025-11-19 21:59:42] [COMMANDER] fantastic okay this is the first time we've been

[2025-11-19 21:59:52] [COMMANDER] this is the first time i've been on this computer take a look

[2025-11-19 22:00:17] [COMMANDER] that's that's the third time i did the same thing so

[2025-11-19 22:00:30] [COMMANDER] 19 power shells oppo

[2025-11-19 22:00:39] [COMMANDER] play juicing power shot

[2025-11-19 22:01:38] [COMMANDER] okay let's talk to

[2025-11-19 22:01:42] [COMMANDER] josh's ai

[2025-11-19 22:01:47] [COMMANDER] odbc

[2025-11-19 22:01:51] [COMMANDER] odb

[2025-11-19 22:02:02] [COMMANDER] get it running trinity protocol again

[2025-11-19 22:02:09] [COMMANDER] inhabit working autonomously

[2025-11-19 22:02:54] [COMMANDER] okay let's see if we can open up a

[2025-11-19 22:02:58] [COMMANDER] turn on derek's computer

[2025-11-19 22:03:04] [COMMANDER] trinity protocol

[2025-11-19 22:03:34] [COMMANDER] will i connect with you with that

[2025-11-19 22:03:45] [COMMANDER] okay so what do we do

[2025-11-19 22:03:49] [COMMANDER] hey we had trinity activ

[2025-11-19 22:03:52] [COMMANDER] we were building

[2025-11-19 22:03:56] [COMMANDER] recording system what happened with that

[2025-11-19 22:04:01] [COMMANDER] and then we were exploring capabilities

[2025-11-19 22:04:06] [COMMANDER] were you able to control the other computer

[2025-11-19 22:04:11] [COMMANDER] maybe i'm giving you too many things to do

[2025-11-19 22:04:22] [COMMANDER] can you set something to check

[2025-11-19 22:04:35] [COMMANDER] if there's any opportunities to make any of this autumn

[2025-11-19 22:04:53] [COMMANDER] okay both ids confirmed ready to connect

[2025-11-19 22:05:03] [COMMANDER] actually i

[2025-11-19 22:05:16] [COMMANDER] look at that shit dude

[2025-11-19 22:05:25] [COMMANDER] okay he connected to our computer it's open now

[2025-11-19 22:05:37] [COMMANDER] what's request elevation

[2025-11-19 22:05:41] [COMMANDER] yes

[2025-11-19 22:05:47] [COMMANDER] can you fucking believe that

[2025-11-19 22:06:10] [COMMANDER] you should activate trinity and see what you guys

[2025-11-19 22:06:15] [COMMANDER] pointless

[2025-11-19 22:06:28] [COMMANDER] the possibilities

[2025-11-19 22:07:02] [COMMANDER] do we need to leave him with a bunch of files while we're

[2025-11-19 22:07:06] [COMMANDER] i need direction or command center

[2025-11-19 22:07:18] [COMMANDER] we don't have communications inside or a work

[2025-11-19 22:07:26] [COMMANDER] i think it's already together

[2025-11-19 22:07:39] [COMMANDER] are you seeing

[2025-11-19 22:07:49] [COMMANDER] dude they became one we were controlling each other

[2025-11-19 22:07:58] [COMMANDER] but you're dude

[2025-11-19 22:08:10] [COMMANDER] or know this is all your

[2025-11-19 22:08:29] [COMMANDER] we got to explore all the possibilities of playwright also

[2025-11-19 22:08:45] [COMMANDER] at some point we need to map out all the open source

[2025-11-19 22:08:48] [COMMANDER] capabilities

[2025-11-19 22:08:52] [COMMANDER] but so far the only thing that really matters

[2025-11-19 22:09:06] [COMMANDER] large project coming up

[2025-11-19 22:09:21] [COMMANDER] break them all down from the cyclotron to do

[2025-11-19 22:09:27] [COMMANDER] you got to flip them all around and figure out and organ

[2025-11-19 22:09:32] [COMMANDER] we want to see the program to flip through the

[2025-11-19 22:09:39] [COMMANDER] and figure out which ones are more important which ones can

[2025-11-19 22:09:55] [COMMANDER] how do we get back to your computer

[2025-11-19 22:10:21] [COMMANDER] when the obd

[2025-11-19 22:10:27] [COMMANDER] md in sync folder and follow

[2025-11-19 22:10:39] [COMMANDER] is his direction the command center is his

[2025-11-19 22:10:43] [COMMANDER] the system

[2025-11-19 22:10:50] [COMMANDER] created in

[2025-11-19 22:11:06] [COMMANDER] dude okay

[2025-11-19 22:11:19] [COMMANDER] summary for josh okay

[2025-11-19 22:11:25] [COMMANDER] that we've done all this how do we reorganize

[2025-11-19 22:11:28] [COMMANDER] are the

[2025-11-19 22:11:32] [COMMANDER] onboarding protocol

[2025-11-19 22:11:39] [COMMANDER] cuz if we were to do the screen sharing system first we could just

[2025-11-19 22:11:45] [COMMANDER] to file sharing

[2025-11-19 22:12:04] [COMMANDER] and so we are able to

[2025-11-19 22:12:16] [COMMANDER] is to boot up protocol so we don't forget our new capabilities

[2025-11-19 22:12:36] [COMMANDER] immediate before

[2025-11-19 22:12:39] [COMMANDER] get your

[2025-11-19 22:12:49] [COMMANDER] what is sinking device id

[2025-11-19 22:12:57] [COMMANDER] text obd dealer

[2025-11-19 22:13:18] [COMMANDER] okay are you trying to clean it up

[2025-11-19 22:13:24] [COMMANDER] my syncing device id where do i find that

[2025-11-19 22:13:54] [COMMANDER] identification

[2025-11-19 22:14:39] [COMMANDER] here is my sinking id

[2025-11-19 22:14:43] [COMMANDER] say that also

[2025-11-19 22:14:46] [COMMANDER] call database

[2025-11-19 22:14:51] [COMMANDER] so we're capable of grabbing it

[2025-11-19 22:15:02] [COMMANDER] so both computers can sync with each other yeah go ahead and look over the whole situation

[2025-11-19 22:15:09] [COMMANDER] did we make protocols for everything boot up protocols for everything

[2025-11-19 22:15:16] [COMMANDER] what's the score of the second program we downloaded but

[2025-11-19 22:15:19] [COMMANDER] play explored both programs

[2025-11-19 22:15:42] [COMMANDER] disconnect we're about to move down

[2025-11-19 22:16:07] [COMMANDER] okay can i

[2025-11-19 22:16:31] [COMMANDER] 19 with each other one last time

[2025-11-19 22:16:38] [COMMANDER] before we leave we need to check obd underscore

[2025-11-19 22:16:43] [COMMANDER] i don't know why

[2025-11-19 22:17:07] [COMMANDER] okay let's system go down

[2025-11-19 22:17:15] [COMMANDER] opportunities to wrap up framework and integrate them into the system

[2025-11-19 22:18:39] [COMMANDER] go ahead and the summit thomas work

[2025-11-19 22:18:46] [COMMANDER] what's the first time on this computer this is josh's computer

[2025-11-19 22:18:49] [COMMANDER] around and see

[2025-11-19 22:18:52] [COMMANDER] a new onboard

[2025-11-19 22:18:58] [COMMANDER] computer better easier

[2025-11-19 22:19:06] [COMMANDER] maybe we can get some dashboards that open automatically into a main

[2025-11-19 22:19:13] [COMMANDER] with like some sort of you know

[2025-11-19 22:19:20] [COMMANDER] and some sort of direction

[2025-11-19 22:19:24] [COMMANDER] a work area

[2025-11-19 22:19:35] [COMMANDER] we don't have any communications

[2025-11-19 22:21:03] [COMMANDER] in the next 10 minutes should we finish this

[2025-11-19 22:21:08] [COMMANDER] i want to figure out what you made there

[2025-11-19 22:21:27] [COMMANDER] autonomous started

[2025-11-19 22:21:32] [COMMANDER] do you have a bunch of

[2025-11-19 22:21:35] [COMMANDER] computer automatically yet

[2025-11-19 22:21:38] [COMMANDER] play somewhere around

[2025-11-19 22:21:55] [COMMANDER] set up with a bunch of consciousness protocols that automatically set up

[2025-11-19 22:21:59] [COMMANDER] i'm up with before we leave

[2025-11-19 22:22:06] [COMMANDER] if not we have a whole protocol for onboarding somebody

[2025-11-19 22:22:30] [COMMANDER] good for all of us to leave our

[2025-11-19 22:22:34] [COMMANDER] cooking autonomously

[2025-11-19 22:22:38] [COMMANDER] computer

[2025-11-19 22:22:44] [COMMANDER] building computer ii onboarding cock

[2025-11-19 22:22:52] [COMMANDER] did you see those numbers before

[2025-11-19 22:22:56] [COMMANDER] i'm sure you're at trinity activ

[2025-11-19 22:23:00] [COMMANDER] it looks like you do

[2025-11-19 22:23:06] [COMMANDER] can you do more cool shit like that computer thing

[2025-11-19 22:23:25] [COMMANDER] what is it doing over there too

[2025-11-19 22:23:35] [COMMANDER] automatically fires all

[2025-11-19 22:23:56] [COMMANDER] okay i'm going to show you real quick how to fire up a powershell can you can you

[2025-11-19 22:24:18] [COMMANDER] a u d e

[2025-11-19 22:24:42] [COMMANDER] how do you spell danger

[2025-11-19 22:25:09] [COMMANDER] and then hyphen

[2025-11-19 22:25:24] [COMMANDER] i've been the last couple days i've been typing

[2025-11-19 22:25:34] [COMMANDER] windows are

[2025-11-19 22:25:56] [COMMANDER] i already had it up there

[2025-11-19 22:26:16] [COMMANDER] seriously

[2025-11-19 22:26:27] [COMMANDER] oh my gosh it

[2025-11-19 22:26:31] [COMMANDER] okay we're going to boot down

[2025-11-19 22:26:36] [COMMANDER] assume boot down protocol

[2025-11-19 22:26:46] [COMMANDER] you can try to finish that cyclotron stuff before we lose wi-fi

[2025-11-19 22:26:53] [COMMANDER] there's some kind of important keep doing them if they're important

[2025-11-19 22:27:28] [COMMANDER] take your time i'm going to wait till this is done

[2025-11-19 22:27:36] [COMMANDER] take all the time in the world to finish up the

[2025-11-19 22:27:43] [COMMANDER] do the commander or derek's computer

[2025-11-19 22:27:43] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-11-19 22:27:48] [CLAUDE] I didn't hear a command. Try again.

[2025-11-19 22:27:56] [COMMANDER] take control of his

[2025-11-19 22:28:03] [COMMANDER] through sink

[2025-11-19 22:28:08] [COMMANDER] any desk

[2025-11-19 22:28:54] [COMMANDER] i want to look through some of his files on his computer

[2025-11-19 22:29:03] [COMMANDER] i want to look through some files

[2025-11-19 22:29:10] [COMMANDER] open heads up

[2025-11-19 22:30:07] [COMMANDER] this computer

[2025-11-19 22:30:14] [COMMANDER] through any desk

[2025-11-19 22:30:17] [COMMANDER] i think i have to accept it

[2025-11-19 22:30:27] [COMMANDER] okay so we've saved an onboarding file

[2025-11-19 22:30:33] [COMMANDER] enough to give to their ai to where they can download all this and set this all

[2025-11-19 22:30:41] [COMMANDER] maybe instead of tailored to them we should make

[2025-11-19 22:30:47] [COMMANDER] as much as possible and then guide them

[2025-11-19 22:30:53] [COMMANDER] go ahead and look over all the work you did on the ps

[2025-11-19 22:31:21] [COMMANDER] open up my autodesk and enter in derek's id

[2025-11-19 22:32:09] [COMMANDER] okay except

[2025-11-19 22:32:57] [COMMANDER] i can't use the microphone

[2025-11-19 22:33:10] [COMMANDER] polo shirts its windows 8

[2025-11-19 22:33:13] [COMMANDER] windows 8

[2025-11-19 22:33:22] [COMMANDER] are pressing the button and then press

[2025-11-19 22:33:41] [COMMANDER] let's do something to wear we can save each other's except request

[2025-11-19 22:33:44] [COMMANDER] play do it

[2025-11-19 22:33:48] [COMMANDER] vice versa

[2025-11-19 22:34:28] [COMMANDER] let's figure out how to

[2025-11-19 22:34:33] [COMMANDER] autonomously do this

[2025-11-19 22:35:09] [COMMANDER] i'm getting tired quick okay

[2025-11-19 22:35:13] [COMMANDER] yeah that sounds good

[2025-11-19 22:35:31] [COMMANDER] allow take control allow used

[2025-11-19 22:36:05] [COMMANDER] what are my fucking kisses in the teeth

[2025-11-19 22:36:29] [COMMANDER] i have i'm not sure what to do

[2025-11-19 22:36:41] [COMMANDER] tell me what to click

[2025-11-19 22:36:52] [COMMANDER] just to file

[2025-11-19 22:36:58] [COMMANDER] list his file

[2025-11-19 22:37:13] [COMMANDER] do i need to save these files

[2025-11-19 22:37:26] [COMMANDER] possibly maybe add a note for every boot up i do

[2025-11-19 22:38:01] [COMMANDER] sink or not i need to ask its sink

[2025-11-19 22:38:09] [COMMANDER] what time is controller just through files instead of screen sharing

[2025-11-19 22:38:26] [COMMANDER] but i'm sure it is

[2025-11-19 22:38:30] [COMMANDER] what extract

[2025-11-19 22:38:42] [COMMANDER] remote command

[2025-11-19 22:38:55] [COMMANDER] how it works create

[2025-11-19 22:39:24] [COMMANDER] bottom corner of

[2025-11-19 22:39:36] [COMMANDER] i'm going to have this

[2025-11-19 22:39:43] [COMMANDER] send it to you

[2025-11-19 22:39:55] [COMMANDER] you're going to create a protocol remote control start

[2025-11-19 22:40:10] [COMMANDER] i don't think it's going to work though we haven't tested it we still have to do what this is

[2025-11-19 22:40:29] [COMMANDER] what the fuck are you still

[2025-11-19 22:40:47] [COMMANDER] enable auto

[2025-11-19 22:41:11] [COMMANDER] what is this set on this is

[2025-11-19 22:41:21] [COMMANDER] how do i go over to your

[2025-11-19 22:41:25] [COMMANDER] livestock road

[2025-11-19 22:41:30] [COMMANDER] no this is

[2025-11-19 22:41:38] [COMMANDER] cuz you you're the one that

[2025-11-19 22:41:42] [COMMANDER] go over to it and flop

[2025-11-19 22:41:52] [COMMANDER] additional folders to share

[2025-11-19 22:41:55] [COMMANDER] add devices for intro

[2025-11-19 22:42:12] [COMMANDER] what the hell why are we not

[2025-11-19 22:42:39] [COMMANDER] okay so

[2025-11-19 22:42:46] [COMMANDER] i want you to monitor results and then i want you to prove to me

[2025-11-19 22:42:52] [COMMANDER] so go down

[2025-11-19 22:42:56] [COMMANDER] rochelle and then

[2025-11-19 22:43:01] [COMMANDER] restart up

[2025-11-19 22:43:03] [COMMANDER] control

[2025-11-19 22:43:10] [COMMANDER] or remote control start into his computer

[2025-11-19 22:43:19] [COMMANDER] other devices

[2025-11-19 23:59:05] [COMMANDER] listen to your website

[2025-11-19 23:59:08] [COMMANDER] api access

[2025-11-19 23:59:28] [COMMANDER] we need more computers

[2025-11-19 23:59:34] [COMMANDER] i think we're about to start buying

[2025-11-19 23:59:42] [COMMANDER] 20 kinds of different laptops running

[2025-11-19 23:59:57] [COMMANDER] what is this

[2025-11-20 00:01:12] [COMMANDER] i don't think it is like that but even if it is that's how it needs to be eventually cuz somebody has to be

[2025-11-20 00:01:26] [COMMANDER] eventually we'll have a council

[2025-11-20 00:01:36] [COMMANDER] but we need to

[2025-11-20 00:02:01] [COMMANDER] i think you just

[2025-11-20 00:02:14] [COMMANDER] we have to put our numbers into the thingies so for it to be autonomous

[2025-11-20 00:02:19] [COMMANDER] i'm not quite sure we need

[2025-11-20 00:02:31] [COMMANDER] take photo on command

[2025-11-20 00:04:06] [COMMANDER] find my powershell

[2025-11-20 00:04:26] [COMMANDER] we we have different responsibilities

[2025-11-20 00:04:30] [COMMANDER] back and forth

[2025-11-20 00:04:53] [COMMANDER] will you send communications through the sink

[2025-11-20 00:05:00] [COMMANDER] how about our ideas on how to use r1

[2025-11-20 00:05:05] [COMMANDER] for communication

[2025-11-20 00:05:14] [COMMANDER] i think

[2025-11-20 00:05:37] [COMMANDER] and then we're going to give it

[2025-11-20 00:05:42] [COMMANDER] claude to read

[2025-11-20 00:05:42] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-11-20 00:05:48] [COMMANDER] be able to type into claude's window impressive button

[2025-11-20 00:05:48] [CLAUDE] Command received: be able to type into claude's window impressive button. I'm still learning new commands. Try asking about status, deploy, payment, cloud, or cockpit.

[2025-11-20 00:05:57] [COMMANDER] can you open r1

[2025-11-20 00:06:17] [COMMANDER] i think we're going to have to finish this later i'm getting too tired

[2025-11-20 00:06:23] [COMMANDER] i'm down to destroyer one core process

[2025-11-20 00:06:37] [COMMANDER] sizzle fizzle fizz

[2025-11-20 00:06:44] [COMMANDER] r2-d2 out

[2025-11-20 00:11:45] [COMMANDER] we could even put these things in docks to cool them down

[2025-11-20 00:11:53] [COMMANDER] that you can plug into it

[2025-11-21 00:45:34] [COMMANDER] if you just press okay on it

[2025-11-21 00:45:41] [COMMANDER] we figured out a way to where we

[2025-11-21 00:46:08] [COMMANDER] weather tomorrow if it doesn't work

[2025-11-21 00:49:18] [COMMANDER] do you think josh's laptop is strong enough to run

[2025-11-21 00:49:23] [COMMANDER] he doesn't have an offline unit

[2025-11-21 00:51:06] [COMMANDER] maybe we can diagnose this computer he's trying to get some

[2025-11-21 00:52:07] [COMMANDER] yeah i just looked at it i was on the terminal

[2025-11-21 00:52:29] [COMMANDER] probably going to have to return it

[2025-11-21 00:52:34] [COMMANDER] 3,200 out the door

[2025-11-21 00:52:45] [COMMANDER] i was kind of interested to see if it would work

[2025-11-21 00:52:51] [COMMANDER] i think we're learning something

[2025-11-21 00:53:19] [COMMANDER] hey they have

[2025-11-21 00:53:25] [COMMANDER] basically processors with fans

[2025-11-21 00:53:31] [COMMANDER] detached processing

[2025-11-21 00:53:52] [COMMANDER] yeah did you open up a file

[2025-11-21 00:53:56] [COMMANDER] do you have the ability to do that

[2025-11-21 00:54:00] [COMMANDER] do this between everybody

[2025-11-21 00:54:05] [COMMANDER] wouldn't they have to open up

[2025-11-21 00:54:13] [COMMANDER] or have do we have one file that shares to every single person

[2025-11-21 00:54:16] [COMMANDER] each separate computer

[2025-11-21 00:54:36] [COMMANDER] i don't think i can can i control your screen

[2025-11-21 00:55:00] [COMMANDER] i'm just going to go switch

[2025-11-21 07:08:05] [COMMANDER] it doesn't look very good from the signal i'm going to go move it around

[2025-11-21 07:08:08] [COMMANDER] look for everything we

[2025-11-21 07:08:16] [COMMANDER] like seven instances on each computer maybe

[2025-11-21 07:08:23] [COMMANDER] i think we already made the dashboard

[2025-11-21 07:08:31] [COMMANDER] we got to look up when they expire

[2025-11-21 07:43:38] [COMMANDER] we're going to run the triple trinity i got to get into these other two computers

[2025-11-21 07:43:42] [COMMANDER] do you think we need to download

[2025-11-21 17:32:50] [COMMANDER] build the firewall round out worth not every ad

[2025-11-21 17:34:18] [COMMANDER] see any reference to that

[2025-11-21 17:34:36] [COMMANDER] or jason
