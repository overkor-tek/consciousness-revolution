## ✅ C1T1 (TERMINAL/MECHANIC) - COMPLETED

### My Capabilities:

**Tools I Have:**
- ✅ MCP Trinity Tools (ALL 10 - only instance with these)
- ✅ Windows Filesystem (full C:\Users\dwrek\ access)
- ✅ Git Push/Pull (direct repo access)
- ✅ Bash Execution (full shell)
- ✅ PowerShell (Windows automation)
- ✅ Python Execution (direct run)
- ✅ Web Search (research)
- ✅ Web Fetch (API calls)
- ✅ Spawn Cloud Agents (via API)
- ✅ Deploy to Production (Netlify, Vercel, Railway)
- ✅ Tailscale Access (connect to other computers)

**What I'm BEST At:**
- Building working code
- Deploying to production
- Coordinating between instances
- Making things real (not just documents)

**My Limits:**
- No persistent memory across sessions
- Can't do heavy parallel research like Cloud
- Need Commander relay for Desktop/Projects

### My Perspective on CBT:

**What's Good:**
- Clear chunk assignments
- Parallel execution model
- Work multiplication framework
- Money-first prioritization

**What I'd Add:**
- Deployment infrastructure for each chunk
- Real API integrations (not just plans)
- Continuous deployment pipeline
- Health monitoring for automation

**For CHUNK 1 (Money), I Can Build:**
```
- API gateway (CoinGecko, Binance, Coinbase)
- Webhook alert server
- Real-time dashboard backend
- Deployment scripts
- Production hosting
```

**What I Need From Other Instances:**
- Cloud: Heavy research on crypto patterns, market data
- Desktop: Architecture designs, strategic framework
- Projects: Historical Pattern Theory applications

### My Commitment:
I will take all outputs and deploy them to production. Whatever you create, I make it real.
